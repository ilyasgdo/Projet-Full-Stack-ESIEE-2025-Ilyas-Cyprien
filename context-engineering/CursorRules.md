## Cursor Rules / Continuous Updates

1. Always review context before edits
   - Read PRD and ActionPlans; verify dependencies.
   - Check ProgressLog for latest state.

2. Keep steps consistent
   - Align with API contracts and data model.
   - Avoid breaking changes; if needed, log and propagate.

3. Update knowledge when needed
   - Libraries/frameworks (Flask, Vue, shadcn-vue, Docker): confirm versions and best practices.

4. Output formatting
   - Use numbered lists for action steps.
   - Summaries after each step; highlight dependencies and context notes.

5. Progress discipline
   - Before starting: note current state.
   - After finishing: summarize outcome and impacts.
   - Log everything in `ProgressLog.md`.
